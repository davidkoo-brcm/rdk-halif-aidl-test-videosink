 * @par The Hardware Porting Kit
 * HPK is the next evolution of the well-defined Hardware Abstraction Layer
 * (HAL), but augmented with more comprehensive documentation and test suites
 * that OEM or SOC vendors can use to self-certify their ports before taking
 * them to RDKM for validation or to an operator for final integration and
 * deployment. The Hardware Porting Kit effectively enables an OEM and/or SOC
 * vendor to self-certify their own Video Accelerator devices, with minimal RDKM
 * assistance.
